The proudest moment of my life was when I crossed the finish line at the 2017 Toronto marathon. It was the first marathon I
had ever done in my life and it was the culmination of a lot of hard word and pain.

Like many people, I had always dreamed of running a marathon. Also as most people, I had hated running and could barely run for 5 minutes,
let alone 26.2 miles. For most of my life, the idea of running on was a fantasy, something I thought would be nice but never actually tried
to accomplish. It all changed when I was 21, and decided to go for a mile run. There wasn't a reason why I wanted to run that day, I just thought it
was a nice day and decided to run. It was an excruciating 10 minutes, after which I swore off ever running again. But then the next day came and I decided to
run again and to this time run a little further. I kept repeating everyday, running further and further until I was running 6 miles on daily basis. I had become
addicted to running and the feeling of bliss that came after going for a run. I repeated the daily routine for an entire year up until my 2 friends mentioned going
on a post graduation vacation to Toronto to run the marathon.
